	{\bf Abstract.}
	We propose, analyze and test two novel fully discrete decoupled linearized algorithms for a nonlinearly coupled reaction-diffusion-advection $N$-species competition model with harvesting or stocking effort. The time-stepping algorithms are first and second order accurate in time and optimally accurate in space. Stability and optimal convergence theorems of the decoupled schemes are proved rigorously. We verify the predicted convergence rates of our analysis and efficacy of the algorithms using numerical experiments and synthetic data for analytical test problems. We also study the effect of harvesting or stocking and diffusion parameters on the evolution of species population density numerically, and observe the co-existence scenario subject to optimal harvesting or stocking.\\

	\section{Introduction} 
	One of the most important concerns in population dynamics in an environmental approach is the impact of harvesting or stocking, which is critical for the best management of limited resources to maintain ecological balance \cite{clark1974mathematical,dai1998coexistence,li2011optimal,otunuga2021time,yang2019optimal,zhang2003optimal}. When a population is harvested, it signifies that its size is being reduced by hunting, fishing, or other forms of capture. In \cite{braverman2009optimal,korobenko2013persistence, roques2007population}, there are few studies about harvesting of one or two populations, and in many cases, they are insufficient to illustrate the genuine circumstances.
	Additional intriguing situations that show either coexistence or competitive exclusion by others are discovered when harvesting is considered for two or more interacting population dynamics \cite{clayton1997bringing,leung1995optimal,liu2016optimal, stigter2004optimal}. A predator-prey system's total behavior is explored in \cite{brauer1982constant} under constant harvesting or stocking of one or both species. The constitutive equation of population dynamics, such as competition and prey-predator models, which serves to explain the pattern and illustrate the impacts of harvesting, is reaction-diffusion-advection. In a reaction-diffusion-advection $N$-species competition model with harvesting or stocking, which is controlled by the following system of nonlinear evolutionary equations, we explore the most effective and accurate numerical approximation of population dynamics \cite{adan2022role,braverman2019interplay, wong2009analysis}: When $i=1,2,\cdots,N$
	%When harvesting is assumed for two or more interacting population dynamics, more fascinating scenarios are found \cite{clayton1997bringing,leung1995optimal,liu2016optimal, stigter2004optimal} that show either coexistence or competitive exclusion by others. Under constant harvesting or stocking of one or both species, a predator-prey system's overall behavior is examined in \cite{brauer1982constant}. The constitutive equation of population dynamics, such as competition and prey-predator models, is reaction-diffusion-advection, which helps to present the pattern and depict the impacts of harvesting.
	%We consider the most efficient and accurate numerical approximation of the population dynamics in a reaction-diffusion-advection $N$-species competition model with harvesting or stocking, which is governed by the following system of nonlinear evolutionary equations \cite{adan2022role,braverman2019interplay, wong2009analysis}: For $i=1,2,\cdots,N$
	\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t}=\mathcal{D}_i\Delta u_i-\beta_i\nabla\cdot(u_i\nabla K)+r_iu_i\left(1-\gamma_i-\frac{1}{K}\sum\limits_{j=1}^N u_j\right)+f_i, \hspace{2mm}\forall (t, \bx)\in (0,T]\times\Omega,\label{RDE1}
\end{align}
\jaman{Mohebujjaman says: In some places I see $\bx$ and in some other placess it is $x$. Please mention the difference between them. Also, to be consistent, if you want to use bold x, please use $\backslash bx$.}

\jaman{Mohebujjaman says: The symbols $\beta$ and $u$ look very close to each other, what if we replace $\beta$ by $\beta$?}
along with known initial and boundary conditions, where $u_i$, $\mathcal{D}_i$, $\beta_i$, $r_i$, and $\gamma_i$ indicate the $i^{th}$ competing species' population density, diffusion rate, advection rate, intrinsic growth rate, and harvesting or stocking coefficient, respectively. The number of species in the competition is denoted by $N$; if $N=1$, the model \eqref{RDE1} depicts a simple logistic growth model of a single species. $K$ represents the heterogeneous environment's carrying capacity, $f_i$ the forcing, $t$ the time, ${\bf x}\in\Omega$ the spatial variable, $\Omega$ the domain, and $T$ the simulation end time. In the model \eqref{RDE1}, the harvesting rate is considered to be proportional to the intrinsic growth rate, and the harvesting or stocking coefficient $\gamma_i<1$. When $\gamma_i=1$, the growth function of the  $i^{th}$ species decreases.
The difficulty in modeling equation \eqref{RDE1} is that we must solve a non-linearly coupled system of partial differential equations at each time step, where the intrinsic growth rates and carrying capacity are all space and time dependent. A three-species competition-diffusion-advection model with constant intrinsic growth rate in a homogeneous environment ($K\equiv$ constant) without harvesting or stocking is provided by Wong in his 2009 analysis (see \cite{wong2009analysis}). Although only the first-order system in a finite element scenario was explored, and no numerical experiments were provided beyond the convergence rate verification, the author offered two decoupled time-stepping discrete schemes and their convergence rates. In \cite{adan2022role}, the optimal harvesting in regulating species density in a two-species competition model with a diverse habitat is examined using a fully-discrete backward-Euler decoupled time-stepping algorithm without any discrete algorithm analysis. In \cite{ainseba2008reaction}, a Lotka-Volterra interactions model with no-flux boundary conditions in the presence of prey-taxis and spatial diffusion is given, and the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution is examined. Kamrujjaman et al. investigated the spatial-temporal impacts of the logistic and Gilpin-Ayala growth functions with starving type diffusion in a single species population with stocking \cite{kamrujjaman2022spatio, Zahan2022Mathmatical}. They investigated the properties of species stability in terms of their survival and extinction. They also established the presence of optimal harvesting attempts in the situation of space-dependent carrying capacity. They presented their findings analytically and numerically. The main focus was on the analytical approach rather than claiming any robust numerical algorithm. The findings of this chapter are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Examine two fully discrete, decoupled, and linearized time-stepping algorithms for approximating \eqref{RDE1} solutions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item  The first-order backward-Euler formula is used in Algorithm \ref{Algn2} to approximate the temporal derivative, and the immediately preceding time-step solution is used to linearize the non-linear component.
	\item Algorithm \ref{Algn2} demonstrates the Decoupled Backward Difference Formula 2 (DBDF-2) scheme, which consists of a second-order correct time derivative approximation formula that linearizes the non-linear term by approximating the unknown solution at the previous time-step. 
\end{itemize}
\item Investigate the stability of  Decoupled Backward-Euler (DBE) method and  Decoupled Backward Difference Formula 2 (DBDF-2).
\item Provide the convergence analysis of two methods that is estimate the errors of DBE and DBDF-2 method.
\item Numerical simulation illustrates the effects of different parameters like diffusion, advection and harvesting.

Here, $K$ represents carrying capacity of the heterogeneous environment, $f_i$ the forcing, $t$ the time, ${\bf x}\in\Omega$ the spatial variable, $\Omega$ the domain, and $T$ the simulation end time. It is assumed  that the harvesting rate is proportional to the intrinsic growth rate in the model \eqref{RDE1}, and the harvesting or stocking coefficient $\gamma_i<1$.

\subsection*{Significance of the work}
In this paper, we propose, analyze, and test two fully discrete and decoupled linearized stable time-stepping algorithms of a non-linearly coupled system of reaction-diffusion-advection equations that describes an $N$-species competition model in a heterogeneous environment with harvesting or stocking. We provide rigorous analysis of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the algorithms together with the priori error estimates by proving their stability and convergence theorems. We prove that the both algorithms are optimally accurate in time and space. The numerical tests are presented showing their convergence rates on some known analytical test problems varying number of species. The solution at each time-step can be computed simultaneously for each species in the competition, which can reduce a huge computational cost when compared to coupled non-linear algorithms. A series of numerical experiments are given that show the effect of exponentially varying carrying capacity, non-stationary intrinsic growth rates, varying diffusion parameters, and harvesting or stocking on the population density of the species in the competition.

To the best of our knowledge, the proposed efficient fully-discrete algorithms of the $N$-species reaction-diffusion competition model in \eqref{RDE1} with harvesting or stocking have not been investigated to date. The proposed algorithms are expected to enable new tools for large-scale computing in population dynamics.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section \ref{notation-preliminaries}, we present some necessary notation and preliminaries for a thorough analysis. We present two fully discrete decoupled schemes and analyze them in Section \ref{fully-discrete-schme}. In Section \ref{numerical-experiments}, we perform several numerical experiments to support the theoretical findings in Section \ref{fully-discrete-schme}. Finally, the conclusion and discussions of future research are given in Section \ref{conclusion}.

\section{Notation and Preliminaries} \label{notation-preliminaries} Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d (d\in\{1,2,3\})$ be a  convex domain with boundary $\partial\Omega$. For a given carrying capacity $K:(0,T]\times\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, we define
\begin{align}
K_{\min}:=\inf\limits_{(t,{\bx})\in (0,T]\times\Omega}|K(t,\bx)|,\label{kmin-def}
\end{align}
and make the assumption that $K_{\min}>0$. The standard $L^2(\Omega)$ norm and inner product are denoted by $\|.\|$ and $(.,.)$. Similarly, the $L^p(\Omega)$ norms and the Sobolev $W_p^k(\Omega)$ norms for $k\in\mathbb{N},\hspace{1mm}1\le p\le \infty$ are $\|.\|_{L^p}$ and $\|.\|_{W_p^k}$, respectively. The Sobolev space $W_2^k(\Omega)^d$ is represented by Hilbert spaces $H^k(\Omega)^d$ with norm $\|.\|_k$.
%    and assume $K_{\min}>0$. The usual $L^2(\Omega)$ norm and inner product are denoted by $\|.\|$ and $(.,.)$, respectively. Similarly, the $L^p(\Omega)$ norms and the Sobolev $W_p^k(\Omega)$ norms are $\|.\|_{L^p}$ and $\|.\|_{W_p^k}$, respectively for $k\in\mathbb{N},\hspace{1mm}1\le p\le \infty$. The Sobolev space $W_2^k(\Omega)^d$ is represented by $H^k(\Omega)^d$ with norm $\|.\|_k$ which are Hilbert spaces.
For $X$ being a normed function space in $\Omega$, $L^p(0,T;X)$ is the space of all functions defined on $(0,T]\times\Omega$ for which the following norm 
\begin{align*}
\|u\|_{L^p(0,T;X)}=\left(\int_0^T\|u\|_{X}^pdt\right)^\frac{1}{p},\hspace{2mm}p\in[1,\infty)
\end{align*}
is finite. For $p=\infty$, the usual modification is used in the definition of this space. We denote $$\|u\|_{\infty,\infty}:=\|u\|_{L^\infty\big(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega)^d\big)}.$$ The natural function spaces for our problem are
\begin{align*}
X:&=H_0^1(\Omega)=\big\{v\in L^2(\Omega) :\nabla v\in L^2(\Omega)^{d},\hspace{1mm}  v=0 \hspace{1mm} \mbox{on}\hspace{1mm}   \partial \Omega\big\}.
\end{align*}
In the dual space of $X$ and for an element $f$ , we define the norm as
$$\|f\|_{-1}:=\sup\limits_{v\in X}\frac{(f,v)}{\|\nabla v\|}.$$
Recall the Poincar\'e inequality holds in $X$: There exists $C$ depending only on $\Omega$ satisfying for all $\phi\in X$,
\[
\| \phi \| \le C \| \nabla \phi \|.
\]
We define the initial conditions $u_i^0:=u_i(0,{\bx})$, and $u_i^1:=u_i(\Delta t,{\bx})$.
We obtain the following by multiplying both sides of \eqref{RDE1} by $v\in X$ and integrating over $\Omega$: Regarding $i=1,2,\cdots,N$

where $P^{L^2}_{X_h}(u)$ is the $L^2$ projection of $u$ into $X_h$ and $|\cdot|_r$ denotes the $H^r$ seminorm. Note that $C>0$ is a generic constant and changes in computation. The following lemma for the discrete Gr\"onwall inequality.

\section{Existence, Uniqueness and Positivity of Solution}\label{section_3}
Consider the following model for single species in the domain $(0,T]\times\Omega$ with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition to establish the uniqueness result.
\begin{align} 
\label{harvest_system_decoupled}
\begin{cases}
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	&\displaystyle\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial t}=\mathcal{D}_1\Delta u_1-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u_1\nabla K)+r_1u_1\left(1-\gamma_1-\frac{u_1}{K}\right), \hspace{2mm}\forall (t,{\bx})\in (0,T]\times\Omega,\\

	\vspace{0.2cm}
	&	u_1(\bx,0)={{u_1}_0}(\bx)\geq,\not\equiv0,\ \displaystyle \bx\in \Omega
\end{cases}
\end{align}
\begin{Lemma}
\label{lm17}
Let  $ {u_1}_0(\bx) \in \Omega, $ be the non-negative and non-trivial initial continuous function and $ {u_1}_0(\bx) > 0 $	in some non-empty open bounded sub-domain $ \Omega_1 \subset \Omega $. Then for any $ t > 0 $, there exists a unique solution $ u_1(t, \bx) $ of the problem \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled} and it is positive.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let us assume
$$\mathcal{F}(\bx,u_1)=\mathcal{G}(\bx,u)u=r_1u_1\left(1-\gamma_1-\frac{u_1}{K}\right),$$
where
$$\mathcal{G}(\bx,u_1)=r_1\left(1-\gamma_1-\frac{u_1}{K}\right).$$
Then, the system \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled} becomes
\begin{align} 
	\label{harvest_system_decoupled2}
	\begin{cases}
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		&\displaystyle\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial t}=\mathcal{D}_1\Delta u_1-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u_1\nabla K)+\mathcal{G}u_1,\hspace{2mm}\forall (t,{\bx})\in (0,T]\times\Omega,\\
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		&\mathcal{D}_1\nabla u_1-\beta_1u_1\nabla K=0,\ \displaystyle \bx\in\partial \Omega,\\
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		&	u_1(\bx,0)={{u_1}_0}(\bx)\geq,\not\equiv0,\ \displaystyle \bx\in \Omega.
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
Here, $\mathcal{F}(\bx,u)$ \jaman{(Mohebujjaman says: Should it be $u_1$?)} is Lipschitz in $u_1$ and is a measurable function in $x$ which is bounded if $u_1$ is restricted to a bounded set, $\Omega$ is bounded, $\partial\Omega$
is of class $ C^{2+{\alpha}}(\Omega)$. The function $\mathcal{F}(x,u_1)$ and $\mathcal{G}(x,u_1)$ are in the class $ C^2 $ in $ u_1 $, and there exists $ K> 0 $ such that $\mathcal{G}(x,u_1)<0$
for $ u_1 > K $. The corresponding eigenvalue problem of \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled2} is represented as follows
\begin{align}
	\label{ef}
	\begin{cases}
		&[\mathcal{D}_1\Delta\xi-\beta_1\nabla\cdot\left(\xi\nabla K\right)]+\mathcal{G}(x,0)=\lambda\xi,\quad \textbf{x}\in \Omega,\\
		&\mathcal{D}_1\nabla\xi-\beta_1\xi\nabla K=0,\quad \textbf{x}\in\partial\Omega
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
The assumptions on $\mathcal{F}(x,u_1)$ imply that we can write $ \mathcal{F}(x,u_1) = (\mathcal{G}(x,u_1) + \mathcal{G}(x,u_1)u_1) u_1 $.
If the principal eigenvalue $\lambda$ is positive of this problem. Let $\Phi$ be an eigenfunction for \eqref{ef} with $\Phi>0$ on $\Omega$. For $\epsilon>0$ sufficiently small,
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{D}_1\Delta(\epsilon\Phi)-\beta_1\nabla\cdot\left((\epsilon\Phi)\nabla K\right)+\mathcal{F}(x,\epsilon\Phi)&=\epsilon\left[\mathcal{D}_1\nabla\Phi-\beta_1\Phi\nabla K+\mathcal{G}(x,0)\Phi\right]+\mathcal{H}(x,\epsilon\Phi)\epsilon^2\Phi^2\\
	&=\epsilon\lambda\Phi+\mathcal{H}(x,\epsilon\Phi)\epsilon^2\Phi^2\\
	&=\epsilon\Phi\{\lambda+\mathcal{H}(x,\epsilon\Phi)\epsilon\Phi\}
\end{align*}
Hence for $\epsilon > 0$ small, $\epsilon\Phi$	 is a subsolution for the elliptic problem
\begin{align}
	\label{ef2}
	\begin{cases}
		&[\mathcal{D}_1\nabla u-\beta_1u\nabla K]_x+\mathcal{F}(x,u_1)=\lambda u_1,\quad \textbf{x}\in \Omega,\\
		&\mathcal{D}_1\nabla u-\beta_1u_1=0,\quad \textbf{x}\in\partial\Omega,\\
		&u_1(x,0)={u_1}_0(x)\geq,\not\equiv0,\ \displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
corresponding to \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled}. If $ \underline{u_1}(x,t) $ is a solution to \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled} with $\underline{u_1}(x,0) = \epsilon\Phi$, then at
$ t = 0 $, $\frac{\partial\underline{u_1}}{\partial t}>0$ on $\Omega$
and general properties of sub-solutions and supersolutions imply
that $\underline{u_1}(x,t)$ is increasing in $ t $. Since $ K > u_1 $ is a supersolution to \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled} we must have
$\underline{u_1}(x,t)\uparrow {u_1}^\ast(x) $ as $ t\rightarrow\infty $, where ${u_1}^\ast$ is the minimal positive solution of \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled}
(we can be sure that ${u_1}^\ast$ is minimal because $\Phi$ will be a strict subsolution for all $ \epsilon> 0 $
sufficiently small). If $ {u_1}(x,t) $ is a solution to \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled} which is initially nonnegative and is
positive on an open subset of $\Omega$, then the strong maximum principle implies $ {u_1}(x,t) > 0 $ on $\overline{\Omega}$ for $ t > 0 $, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}
\begin{Lemma}\label{lm18}
A unique equilibrium solution of \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled} ${u_1}_0^\ast(x)$ exists. Then for any initial solution ${u_1}_0(x)\ge 0,\ {u_1}_0(x)\not\equiv 0$, the solution ${u_1}(t,x)$\ of \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled} satisfies the condition $$\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}{u_1}(t,x)={u_1}^\ast(x)$$ uniformly for $\textbf{x}\in \overline{\Omega}$.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that the hypotheses of Lemma \ref{lm17} are satisfied and that $ \mathcal{F}(x,u_1) =
\mathcal{G}(x,u_1)u_1 $ with $\mathcal{G}(x,u_1)$ strictly decreasing in $ u_1 $ for $ u_1 \ge 0 $. Then the minimal positive
equilibrium ${u_1}^\ast$ is the only positive equilibrium for \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled}. Let ${u_1}^{\ast\ast}$ is a another positive
equilibrium of \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled} with ${u_1}^{\ast\ast}\ne {u_1}^\ast$ then since $ {u_1}^\ast $ is minimal we must have $ {u_1}^{\ast\ast}> {u_1}^\ast $
somewhere on $\Omega$. Since ${u_1}^\ast > 0 $ is an equilibrium of \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled} it is a positive solution to
\begin{align}
	\label{ef3}
	\begin{cases}
		&\mathcal{D}_1\Delta\xi-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(\xi\nabla K)+\mathcal{G}(x,{u_1}^\ast)=\lambda\xi,\quad \textbf{x}\in \Omega,\\
		&\mathcal{D}_1\nabla\xi-\beta_1\xi\nabla K=0,\quad \textbf{x}\in\partial\Omega
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
for any $\xi$, if we let $\lambda=0$, then $\lambda=0$ must be the principal eigenvalue of \eqref{ef3}. Similarly $ {u_1}^{\ast\ast}$ satisfies
\begin{align}
	\label{ef4}
	\begin{cases}
		&\mathcal{D}_1\Delta\xi-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(\xi\nabla K)+\mathcal{G}(x,u^{\ast\ast})=\lambda\xi,\quad \textbf{x}\in \Omega,\\
		&\mathcal{D}_1\xi_x-\beta_1\xi=0,\quad \textbf{x}\in\partial\Omega
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
with $\lambda=0$ for any $\xi$, so $\lambda=0$ in \eqref{ef4} also. However, since $ \mathcal{G}(x,u_1) $ is strictly
decreasing in $u_1$ and $ {u_1}^{\ast\ast}> {u_1}^\ast $ on at least part of $\Omega$, the principal eigenvalue in \eqref{ef4}
must be less than the principal eigenvalue in \eqref{ef3}. Thus, we cannot have $\lambda=0$ in
both \eqref{ef3} and \eqref{ef4}, so \eqref{harvest_system_decoupled} cannot have any equilibrium other than the minimal
equilibrium ${u_1}^\ast$, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}
\begin{Lemma}
\label{lm19}
Let  $ {u_2}_0(x) \in \Omega, $ be the non-negative and non-trivial initial continuous function and $ {u_2}_0(x) > 0 $	in some non-empty open bounded sub-domain $ \Omega_1 \subset \Omega $. Then for any $ t > 0 $, there exists a unique solution $ u_2(t, x) $ of the problem \eqref{harvest_system} and it is positive.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{Lemma}\label{lm20}
A unique equilibrium solution of \eqref{harvest_system} ${u_2}_0^\ast(x)$ exists. Then for any initial solution ${u_2}_0(x)\ge 0,\ {u_2}_0(x)\not\equiv 0$, the solution ${u_2}(t,x)$\ of \eqref{harvest_system} satisfies the condition $$\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}{u_2}(t,x)={u_2}^\ast(x)$$ uniformly for $x\in \overline{\Omega}$.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
The Lemmas \ref{lm19} and \ref{lm20} are analogous to Lemma \ref{lm17} and \ref{lm18}, so we can omit the proofs here. 
\end{proof}
Consider the stationary problem as
\begin{align}
\label{harvest_stationary_decoupled}
\begin{cases}
	&\mathcal{D}_1 \Delta u_1-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u_1\nabla K)+r_1{u_1}{\left[1-\gamma_1-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K}\right]}=0,\quad\displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega,\ t>0 \\
	&\mathcal{D}_2 \Delta u_2-\beta_2\nabla\cdot(u_2\nabla K)+r_2{u_2}{\left[1-\gamma_2-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K}\right]}=0,\quad\displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega,\ t>0 \\
	&\mathcal{D}_1\nabla u_1-\beta_1u_1\nabla K=\mathcal{D}_2\nabla u_2-\beta_2u_2\nabla K=0,\ \displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega,\\
	&	u_1(x,0)={{u_1}_0}(x)\geq,\not\equiv0,\ \displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega\\
	&	u_2(x,0)={{u_2}_0}(x)\geq,\not\equiv0,\ \displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega\\
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Now modify the system in such a way that the system will be harvesting free. Rewrite the first equation of \eqref{harvest_stationary_decoupled} as
\begin{align*}
\vspace{0.2cm}
&\quad\mathcal{D}_1 \Delta u_1-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u_1\nabla K)+{r_1}{u_1}{\left[1-\gamma_1-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K}\right]}=0\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
&=\mathcal{D}_1 \Delta u_1-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u_1\nabla K)+{r_1}{u_1}{\left[(1-\gamma)-(1-\gamma)\frac{u_1+u_2}{K(1-\gamma)}\right]}\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
&=\mathcal{D}_1 \Delta u_1-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u_1\nabla K)+{r_1}{u_1}(1-\gamma){\left[1-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K(1-\gamma)}\right]}\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
&=\mathcal{D}_1 \Delta u_1-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u_1\nabla K)+{r_1}r{u_1}{\left[1-\frac{u_1+u_2}{Kr}\right]}\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
&=\mathcal{D}_1 \Delta u_1-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u_1\nabla K)+{r_1}r{u_1}{\left[1-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K_1}\right]}
\end{align*} 
If we assume $r=1-\gamma\ \text{and}\ K_1=Kr$. Then we obtain
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{D}_1 \Delta u_1-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u_1\nabla K)+rr_1{u_1}{\left[1-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K_1}\right]}=0.
\end{align*}
Similarly the second equation can be written as
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{D}_2 \Delta u_2-\beta_2\nabla\cdot(u_2\nabla K)+rr_1{u_2}{\left[1-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K_1}\right]}=0.
\end{align*}
Finally, the system \eqref{harvest_stationary_decoupled} can be written of the following equivalent form
\begin{align}
\label{harvest_stationary_decoupled2}
\begin{cases}
	&\mathcal{D}_1 \Delta u_1-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u_1\nabla K)+rr_1{u_1}{\left[1-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K_1}\right]}=0,\quad\displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega,\ t>0 \\
	&\mathcal{D}_2 \Delta u_2-\beta_2\nabla\cdot(u_2\nabla K)+rr_1{u_2}{\left[1-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K_1}\right]}=0,\quad\displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega,\ t>0 \\
	&\mathcal{D}_1\nabla u_1-\beta_1u_1\nabla K=\mathcal{D}_2\nabla u_2-\beta_2u_2\nabla K=0,\ \displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega,\\
	&	u_1(x,0)={{u_1}_0}(x)\geq,\not\equiv0,\ \displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega\\
	&	u_2(x,0)={{u_2}_0}(x)\geq,\not\equiv0,\ \displaystyle \textbf{x}\in \Omega\\
\end{cases}
\end{align}
\begin{Lemma}
Suppose that $K_1(x)\not\equiv \text{const}$ and ${u_1}^\ast(x)$ is the positive solution of \eqref{harvest_stationary_decoupled2}, then
$$\displaystyle\int_\Omega{r_1(x)K_1\left(1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right)}dx>0.$$
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $K(x)>0$\ and\ ${u_1}^\ast(x)>0$\ then integrating the first equation of \eqref{harvest_stationary_decoupled2} over the domain, we get
\begin{align*}
	&\displaystyle\int_\Omega{\mathcal{D}_1\Delta {u_1}^{\ast}(x)-\beta_1\nabla\cdot(u^\ast(x)\nabla K)+r{r_1}{u_1}^\ast(x){\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx=0
\end{align*}
By applying homogeneous neumann boundary condition we obtain
\begin{align*}
	&\displaystyle\int_\Omega r{r_1(x){u_1}^\ast(x){\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1(x)}\right]}}dx=0\\
	%		&\Rightarrow\displaystyle\int_\Omega r{r_1(x){u_1}^\ast(x){\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx=0\\
	&\Rightarrow\displaystyle\int_\Omega r{r_1(x)({u_1}^\ast(x)-K_1+K_1){\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx=0\\
	&\Rightarrow\displaystyle\int_\Omega r{r_1(x)({u_1}^\ast(x)-K_1){\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx+\displaystyle\int_\Omega{r_1(x)K_1{\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx=0\\
	&\Rightarrow-\displaystyle\int_\Omega r{r_1(x)(K_1-{u_1}^\ast(x)){\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx+\displaystyle\int_\Omega{r_1(x)K_1{\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx=0\\
	&\Rightarrow-\displaystyle\int_\Omega r{r_1(x)(K_1-K_1\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}){\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx+\displaystyle\int_\Omega{r_1(x)K_1{\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx=0\\
	&\Rightarrow-\displaystyle\int_\Omega r{r_1(x)K_1{\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]^2}}dx+\displaystyle\int_\Omega{r_1(x)K_1{\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx=0\\
	&\Rightarrow\displaystyle\int_\Omega r{r_1(x)K_1{\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]^2}}dx=\displaystyle\int_\Omega{r_1(x)K_1{\left[1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx
\end{align*}
Clearly for ${u_1}^\ast(x)\ne K_1,\ \displaystyle\int_\Omega{r_1(x)K_1{\left[1-\gamma_1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]^2}}dx>0$. Since ${u_1}^\ast(x)=K_1\not\equiv\text{const}$, then ${u_1}^\ast(x)$ is not a solution of \eqref{harvest_stationary_decoupled2}. Therefore,
$$\displaystyle\int_\Omega{r_1(x)K_1{\left[1-\gamma_1-\frac{{u_1}^\ast(x)}{K_1}\right]}}dx>0$$
\end{proof}
%Consider the stationary problem as
%\begin{align}
%	\label{harvest_stationary_decoupled22}
%	\begin{cases}

\begin{Lemma}
Suppose that $K_1(x)\not\equiv \text{const}$ and ${u_2}^\ast(x)$ is the positive solution of \eqref{harvest_stationary_decoupled2}, then
$$\displaystyle\int_\Omega{r_1(x)K\left(1-\frac{{u_2}^\ast(x)}{K}\right)}dx>0.$$
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proof is analogous to the previous lemma so we can omit it here.
\end{proof}
\begin{Th}
Let for $\gamma_1, \gamma_2\in [0,1)$ and any ${u_1}_0(x),{u_2}_0(x)\in C(a,b)$ the system \eqref{harvest_system} has a unique solution $ (u_1,u_2) $. Further, when both initial conditions ${u_1}_0$ and $ {u_2}_0 $ are
non-negative and non-trivial, then $ u_1(t,x) > 0 $ and $ u_2(t,x) > 0 $ for any $ t > 0 $.
\end{Th}
\begin{proof}
The system \eqref{harvest_system} has a non trivial time dependent solution according to \cite{e3}. Let us consider \cite{e3}
$$\rho_{u_1}=\max\left\{\sup_{x\in \Omega}{u_1}_0(x),K(x)\right\},~~\rho_{u_2}=\max\left\{\sup_{x\in \Omega}{u_2}_0(x),K(x)\right\}.$$
Suppose that 
\begin{align}
	&g_1(t,x,u_1,u_2)=r_1u_1{\left[1-\gamma_1-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K}\right]},\\
	& g_2(t,x,u_1,u_2)=r_2{u_2}{\left[1-\gamma_2-\frac{u_1+u_2}{K}\right]},
\end{align}
and define
$$S^\ast\equiv \{(\check{u_1},\check{u_2})\in C([0,\infty)\times \Omega):0\le \check{u_1}\le \rho_{u_1},0\le \check{u_2}\le \rho_{u_2}\}$$
Now the functions $g_1$\ and\ $g_2$\ are quasi-monotone non-increasing Lipshitz functions in $S^\ast$, then the following conditions are satisfied according to \cite{book} 
\begin{align}
	&g_1(t,x,\rho_{u_1},0)\le 0\le g_1(t,x,0,\rho_{u_2})\\
	&g_2(t,x,0,\rho_{u_2})\le 0\le g_2(t,x,\rho_{u_1},0)
\end{align}
Then for the initial solution ${u_1}_0(x),{u_2}_0(x)$ and the class of continuous functions $C([0,\infty)\times \Omega)$ on $[0,\infty)\times \Omega$\ such that
$$({u_1}_0,{u_2}_0)\in S^\ast.$$
Then a unique solution $(u_1(t,x),u_2(t,x))$\ of \eqref{harvest_system} exists in $S^\ast$ for all $(t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times \Omega$. Therefore, $ (u_1(t, x), u_2(t, x))$ is unique and positive solution.

\section{Fully Discrete Schemes} \label{fully-discrete-schme}
%In this section, we propose and analyze two fully discrete, decoupled, and linearized time-stepping algorithms for approximating a solution of \eqref{RDE1}. The Decoupled Backward-Euler (DBE) scheme is presented in Algorithm \ref{Algn1}, which approximates the temporal derivative by first-order backward-Euler formula and the non-linear term is linearized by the immediate previous time-step solution. In Algorithm \ref{Algn2}, we present Decoupled Backward Difference Formula 2 (DBDF-2) scheme, which consists of second-order accurate time derivative approximation formula, and linearizes the non-linear term by second-order approximation of the unknown solution at the previous time-step. 
%
%
For the purpose of approximating \eqref{RDE1} solutions, we describe and analyze two fully discrete, decoupled, and linearized time-stepping algorithms. The first-order backward-Euler formula is used in Algorithm \ref{Algn1} to approximate the temporal derivative, and the immediately preceding time-step solution is used to linearize the non-linear component. In Algorithm \ref{Algn2}, we provide the Decoupled Backward Difference Formula 2 (DBDF-2) scheme, which consists of a second-order accurate time derivative approximation formula that linearizes the non-linear term by approximating the unknown solution at the previous time-step.  For the sake of simplicity, we define for $i=1,2,\cdots,N$
\begin{align}
	\alpha_i:=\cD_i-C\beta_i\|K\|_{\infty,2}-C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}\left(|1-\gamma_i|+\frac{1}{K_{\min}}\right).\label{alpha-def}

\subsection{Stability Analysis}\label{stability-analysis}

The stability theorems and well-posedness of DBE and DBDF-2 schemes are investigated in this section. 

\begin{Lemma}
	There exists a constant $K^*>0$ such that $\|u_{i,h}^n\|_{\infty}\le K^*$ for $i=1,2,\cdots,N$, where $u_{i,h}^n$ is a solution of DBE/DBDF-2 scheme. \label{assumption-1}
\end{Lemma}
In the Lemma \ref{lemma-discrete-bound}, which is found at the end of Section \ref{Convergence-sec}, we shall demonstrate that Assumption \ref{assumption-1} is valid.


\begin{Th}(Stability Analysis of DBE)\label{stability-theorm}
For $i=1,2,\cdots,N$, 
assume $u_{i,h}^0\in L^2(\Omega)^d$, $f_i\in L^2\left(0,T;H^{-1}(\Omega)^d\right)$, $r_i\in L^\infty(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega)^d)$, $K\in L^\infty(0,T;H^2(\Omega)^d),$ $K_{\min}>0$ and under the Assumption \ref{assumption-1}, if $\alpha_i> 0$, then for any $\Delta t>0$
\begin{align}
	\|u_{i,h}^M\|^2+2\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=1}^M\|\nabla u_{i,h}^n\|^2\le\|u_{i,h}^0\|^2+\frac{\Delta t}{\alpha_i}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{M} \|f_i(t^{n})\|_{-1}^2.
\end{align}
\end{Th}



\begin{proof}
Taking $v_{h}=u_{i,h}^{n+1}$ in \eqref{disc-weak-form}, and using the polarization identity
$$(q-p,q)=\frac12\left(\|q-p\|^2+\|q\|^2-\|p\|^2\right),$$
we have
\begin{align}
	&\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\Big(\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}-u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\|u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\Big)+\mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2=\beta_i\left(u_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)+\nonumber\\
	&(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})u_{i,h}^{n+1},u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)-\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) u_{i,h}^{n+1}}{K(t^{n+1})}\sum\limits_{j=1}^Nu_{j,h}^n,u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)+\left(f_i(t^{n+1}),u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right).\label{pol-new}
\end{align}
For the first term on the right-hand-side of \eqref{pol-new}, we use H\"{o}lder's inequality, Sobolev embedding theorem, and Poincar\'e inequalities, to find the following estimate
\begin{align}
	\left(u_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|_{L^3}\|\nabla K(t^{n+1})\|_{L^6}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\nonumber\\&\le C\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^{\frac12}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^{\frac12} \| K(t^{n+1})\|_{H^2(\Omega)}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\nonumber\\&\le C\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{H^2(\Omega)^d}.\label{first-term-right-up}
\end{align}
With the above estimate, we apply H\"{o}lder's inequality on the second and third terms and Cauchy Schwarz's inequality on the forcing term on the right-hand-side of \eqref{pol-new}, we have
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\Big(\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}-u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\|u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\Big)+\mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2 \nonumber\\\le C\beta_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{H^2(\Omega)}+|1-\gamma_i|\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_{\infty}\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\nonumber\\+\Big\|\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\Big\|_\infty\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\|u_{j,h}^n\|_{\infty}+\|f_i(t^{n+1})\|_{-1}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|.\label{before-small-data-assumption}
\end{align}
Use of Poincar\'e inequality and the Assumption \ref{assumption-1}, gives
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\big(\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}-u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\|u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\big)+\mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\nonumber\\\le C\beta_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\|K\|_{L^\infty\big(0,T;H^2(\Omega)^d\big)}+ C|1-\gamma_i|\|r_i\|_{L^\infty\big(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega)^d\big)}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\nonumber\\+\frac{C\|r_i\|_{L^\infty\big(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega)^d\big)}}{\inf\limits_{(t,\bx)\in (0,T]\times\Omega}|K|}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\|f_i(t^{n+1})\|_{-1}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|.
\end{align}
Grouping terms on the left-hand-side and using \eqref{kmin-def}, and\eqref{alpha-def}, yields
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{2\Delta t}&\left(\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}-u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\|u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\right)+\alpha_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2 \le \|f_i(t^{n+1})\|_{-1}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|.
\end{align}

Assume $\alpha_i>0$ for $i=1,2,\cdots,N$, apply Young's inequality, and rearrange, to have
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\left(\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}-u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\|u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\right)+\frac{\alpha_i}{2}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2 \le \frac{1}{2\alpha_i}\|f_i(t^{n+1})\|_{-1}^2.
\end{align}
Now, multiplying both sides by $2\Delta t$, summing over time steps  $n=0,1,\cdots, M-1$, and dropping non-negative terms from the left-hand-side finishes the proof. 
\end{proof}
\begin{Th}(Stability analysis of DBDF-2)\label{stability-theorm2}
For $i=1,2,\cdots,N$, 
suppose $u_{i,h}^0,u_{i,h}^1\in L^2(\Omega)^d$, $f_i\in L^2\left(0,T;H^{-1}(\Omega)^d\right)$, $K_{\min}>0$, $r_i\in L^\infty(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega)^d)$, and under the Assumption \ref{assumption-1}, if $\alpha_i> 0$, then for any $\Delta t>0$
\begin{align}
	\|u_{i,h}^{M}\|^2&+\|2u_{i,h}^{M}-u_{i,h}^{M-1}\|^2+2\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=2}^{M}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\nonumber\\&\le\|u_{i,h}^{1}\|^2+\|2u_{i,h}^{1}-u_{i,h}^{0}\|^2
	+\frac{2\Delta t}{\alpha_i}\sum\limits_{n=2}^{M}\|f_i(t^{n})\|_{-1}^2.
\end{align}
\end{Th}
\begin{proof}
Set $v_{h}=u_{i,h}^{n+1}$ in \eqref{disc-weak-form2}, to obtain
\begin{align}\label{pol-new2}
	&  \Bigg(\frac{3u_{i,h}^{n+1}-4u_{i,h}^{n}+u_{i,h}^{n-1}}{2\Delta  t},u_{i,h}^{n+1}\Bigg)+\mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\nonumber\\&=\beta_i\left(u_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)+(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})u_{i,h}^{n+1},u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right) \nonumber\\
	&-\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) u_{i,h}^{n+1}}{K(t^{n+1})}\sum\limits_{j=1}^N(2u_{j,h}^n-u_{j,h}^{n-1}),u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)+\left(f_i(t^{n+1}),u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right).
\end{align}
Using the upper bound of the first term on the right-hand-side of \eqref{pol-new2} given in  \eqref{first-term-right-up}, and using the following identity
\begin{eqnarray}
	(3p-4q+r,p)=\frac{p^2+(2p-q)^2}{2}-\frac{q^2+(2q-r)^2}{2}+\frac{(p-2q+r)^2}{2},\label{ident}
\end{eqnarray}
we obtain
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{4\Delta t}\Big(&\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\|u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|2u_{i,h}^{n+1}-u_{i,h}^{n}\|^2-\|2u_{i,h}^{n}-u_{i,h}^{n-1}\|^2+\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}-2u_{i,h}^{n}+u_{i,h}^{n-1}\|^2\Big)\nonumber\\&+\mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\le C\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{H^2(\Omega)^d}+(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})u_{i,h}^{n+1},u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\nonumber\\

	\left(f_i(t^{n+1}),u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right).\label{BDF2-identity}
\end{align}
Applying H\"{o}lder's inequality on the second term, H\"{o}lder's and triangle inequalities on the  third term, and Cauchy Schwarz's inequality on the forcing term on the right-hand-side of \eqref{BDF2-identity}, yields
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}
%By using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the property $\|u_i\|\geq\|\nabla u_i\|$, we have

Using the Poincar\'e inequality and the Assumption \ref{assumption-1}, we obtain

Assume $\alpha_i>0$ for $i=1,2,\cdots,N$ and use Young's inequality, to get

\subsection{Convergence Analysis}\label{Convergence-sec}
In this section, we provide finite element error analyses and apriori estimates of the errors in the DBE and DBDF-2 schemes.

\begin{Th}(Error estimation of DBE) Consider $m=\max\{2,k+1\}$, and $i=1,2,\cdots,N$, assume $u_i$ solves \eqref{RDE1} and satisfies
\begin{align*}
	u_i\in L^\infty\big(0,T;H^m(\Omega)^d\big),&\hspace{1mm}u_{i,t}\in L^\infty\big(0,T;L^2(\Omega)^d\big),\hspace{1mm}u_{i,tt}\in L^\infty\big(0,T;L^2(\Omega)^d\big),\\&r_i\in L^\infty\left(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega)^d\right),\text{ and } K_{\min}>0,
\end{align*}

if $\alpha_i>0$ then for $\Delta t>0$ the solution $u_{i,h}$ to the Algorithm  \ref{Algn1} converges to the true solution with
\begin{align}
	\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\|u_i(T)-u_{i,h}^M\|+\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\left\{\alpha_i\Delta t\sum_{n=1}^M\|\nabla \big(u_i(t^n)-u_{i,h}^n\big)\|^2\right\}^{\frac{1}{2}}\le C \big(h^{k}+\Delta t\big).
\end{align}\label{Convergence-analysis-BE}
\end{Th}

\begin{proof}
Firstly, we construct an error equation at the time step $t^{n+1}$, the continuous variational formulations can be written as $\forall v_{h}\in X_h$
\begin{align}
	\Bigg(&\frac{u_{i}(t^{n+1})-u_{i}(t^{n})}{\Delta  t},v_{h}\Bigg)+\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla u_{i}(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{h}\right)-\beta_i\left(u_{i}(t^{n+1})\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{h}\right)\nonumber\\&=
	(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})u_{i}(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right)+\left(f_i(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right)-\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) u_{i}(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\sum\limits_{j=1}^Nu_{j}(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right)+\nonumber\\
	&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\left(\frac{u_{i}(t^{n+1})-u_{i}(t^{n})}{\Delta  t}- u_{i,t}(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right).\label{cont-weak-form}
\end{align}
Denote $e_i^n:=u_i(t^{n+1})-u_{i,h}^n$. Subtract \eqref{disc-weak-form} from \eqref{cont-weak-form} and then rearranging yields
\begin{align}
	\left(\frac{e_{i}^{n+1}-e_{i}^{n}}{\Delta  t},v_{i,h}\right)+\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla e_{i}^{n+1},\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\beta_i\left( e_{i}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})e_{i}^{n+1},v_{i,h}\right)\nonumber\\+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}e_i^{n+1}u_{j,h}^n,v_{i,h}
	\right)=G(t,u_i,v_{i,h}),\label{error-equation}
\end{align}
where \begin{align*}
	G(t,u_i,v_{i,h})=\left(\frac{u_{i}(t^{n+1})-u_{i}(t^{n})}{\Delta  t}- u_{i,t}(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right)+\\
	\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) u_{i}(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\big\{u_{j,h}^{n}-u_{j}(t^{n+1})\big\},v_{i,h}\right).
\end{align*}
We now decompose the errors as follows:
\begin{align*}
	e_{i}^n:& = u_i(t^n)-u_{i,h}^n=(u_i(t^n)-\tilde{u}_i^n)-(u_{i,h}^n-\tilde{u}_i^n):=\eta_{i}^n-\phi_{i,h}^n,
\end{align*}
where $\tilde{u}_i^n: =P_{X_h}^{L^2}(u_i(t^n))\in X_h$ is the $L^2$ projections of $u_j(t^n)$ into $X_h$. Note that $(\eta_{i}^n,v_{i,h})=0\hspace{2mm} \forall v_{i,h}\in X_h$.  Rewriting, we have for $v_{i,h}\in X_h$
\begin{align}
	\Bigg(&\frac{\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}-\phi_{i,h}^{n}}{\Delta  t},v_{i,h}\Bigg)+\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1},\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\beta_i\left( \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\phi_{i,h}^{n+1},v_{i,h}\right)\nonumber\\
	&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}u_{j,h}^n,v_{i,h}
	\right)=\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla \eta_{i}^{n+1},\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\beta_i\left(\eta_{i}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\nonumber\\
	&~~~~~~~~~(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\eta_{i}^{n+1},v_{i,h}\right)+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\eta_i^{n+1}u_{j,h}^n,v_{i,h}
	\right)-G(t,u_i,v_{i,h}).\label{phi-equation}
\end{align}
Choose $v_{i,h}=\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}$, and use the polarization identity in \eqref{phi-equation}, to obtain
\begin{align}\label{all-phi}
	&	\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\left(\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}-\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\|\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\right)+\mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\beta_i\left( \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)-\nonumber\\
	&~~~~~~	(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\phi_{i,h}^{n+1},\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)	+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left( \frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}u_{j,h}^n,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\le \mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla \eta_{i}^{n+1},\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)-\nonumber\\
	&~~~~~~~~	\beta_i\left( \eta_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)-(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\eta_{i}^{n+1},\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\eta_{i}^{n+1} u_{j,h}^n,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)-\nonumber\\
	&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~G\left(t,u_i,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right).
\end{align}
Now, we find the upper-bounds of terms in the above equation. Use H\"{o}lder's inequality, Sobolev embedding theorem, and Poincar\'e inequalities, to find 
\begin{align*}
	\left(\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|_{L^3}\|\nabla K(t^{n+1})\|_{L^6}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le C\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^{\frac12}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^{\frac{1}{2}}\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{H^2(\Omega)^d}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le C\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{L^\infty\big(0,T;H^2(\Omega)^d\big)},\\
	\left(\eta_{i}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le\|\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|_{L^3}\|\nabla K(t^{n+1})\|_{L^6}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le C\|\nabla\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{L^\infty\big(0,T;H^2(\Omega)^d\big)}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|.
\end{align*}
Apply Young's inequality, to have
\begin{align*}
	\beta_i\left(\eta_{i}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\le\frac{\alpha_i}{12}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{C\beta_i^2}{\alpha_i}\|\nabla\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|^2\|K\|_{\infty,2}^2.
\end{align*}
Using H\"older's, and Poincar\'e inequalities, we have
\begin{align*}
	(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\phi_{i,h}^{n+1},\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le|1-\gamma_i|\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_{\infty}\| \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\\&\le C |1-\gamma_i|\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2.
\end{align*}
Next, using triangle, H\"older's, and Poincar\'e inequalities together with the Assumption \ref{assumption-1}, we have
\begin{align*}
	-\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left( \frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) }{K(t^{n+1})}\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}u_{j,h}^n,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\frac{\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_{\infty}}{\inf\limits_\Omega\|K(t^{n+1})\|}\Big|\left(\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}u_{j,h}^n,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\Big|\nonumber\\&\le\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\frac{\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}{K_{\min}}\|u_{j,h}^{n}\|_\infty\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\nonumber\\&\le\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}{K_{\min}}
	\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2.
\end{align*} 
With the assumption $\alpha_i>0$, use Cauchy-Schwarz, and Young's inequalities, to obtain
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla \eta_{i}^{n+1},\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\le \mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla \eta_{i}^{n+1}\|\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\le\frac{\alpha_i}{12}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{3\mathcal{D}_i^2}{\alpha_i}\|\nabla \eta_{i}^{n+1}\|^2.
\end{align*}
Using H\"older's, and Poincar\'e inequalities, Assumption \ref{assumption-1}, and Young's inequality, we have
\begin{align*}
	(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\eta_{i}^{n+1},\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le|1-\gamma_i|\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_\infty\|\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le C|1-\gamma_i|\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}\|\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le\frac{\alpha_i}{12}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{C(1-\gamma_i)^2\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}^2}{\alpha_i}\|\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|^2,\\
	\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\eta_{i}^{n+1} u_{j,h}^n,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\frac{\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_{\infty}}{\inf\limits_\Omega\|K(t^{n+1})\|}\Big|\left(\eta_{i}^{n+1} u_{j,h}^n,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\Big|\\&\le \sum\limits_{j=1}^N\frac{\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}{K_{\min}}\|\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|\| u_{j,h}^n\|_\infty\|\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le \frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}{K_{\min}}\|\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le \frac{\alpha_i}{12}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}^2}{\alpha_iK_{\min}^2}\|\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|^2.
\end{align*}
Now we want to find the upper-bound of \begin{align}    G(t,u_i,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1})=\left(\frac{u_{i}(t^{n+1})-u_{i}(t^{n})}{\Delta  t}- u_{i,t}(t^{n+1}),\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\nonumber\\+\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) u_{i}(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\big\{u_{j,h}^{n}-u_{j}(t^{n+1})\big\},\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right).\label{G-phi}
\end{align}
For some $t^*\in[t^n,t^{n+1}]$, we use Taylor's series expansion, Poincar\'e, Cauchy-Schwarz, and Young's inequalities to obtain the following bound for the first term on the right-hand-side of \eqref{G-phi}
\begin{align*}
	\left(\frac{u_{i}(t^{n+1})-u_{i}(t^{n})}{\Delta  t}- u_{i,t}(t^{n+1}),\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&=\frac{\Delta t}{2}\left(u_{i,tt}(t^*),\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\\&\le\frac{C\Delta t}{2}\left(u_{i,tt}(t^*),\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\\&\le\frac{C\Delta t}{2}\|u_{i,tt}(t^*)\|\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le\frac{\alpha_i}{12}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{C(\Delta t)^2}{\alpha_i}\|u_{i,tt}(t^*)\|^2.
\end{align*}
We can find the upper-bound of the last term on the right-hand-side of \eqref{G-phi} using Taylor's series expansion, Poincar\'e, H\"older's, triangle, and Young's inequalities together with the regularity assumption as
\begin{align*}
	\Bigg(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) u_{i}(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}&\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\big\{u_{j,h}^{n}-u_{j}(t^{n+1})\big\},\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\Bigg)\\&\le \frac{C\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_{\infty}}{\inf\limits_\Omega\|K(t^{n+1})\|}\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(|u_{i}(t^{n+1})\big\{u_{j,h}^{n}-u_{j}(t^{n+1})\big\}\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}|\right)\\&\le\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}{K_{\min}}\|u_{i}(t^{n+1})\|_\infty\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\|u_{j,h}^{n}-u_{j}(t^{n+1})\|\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}{K_{\min}}\|u_{j,h}^{n}-u_{j}(t^{n+1})\|\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{\alpha_i}{12N}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}^2}{\alpha_i K_{\min}^2}\|u_{j,h}^{n}-u_{j}(t^{n+1})\|^2\right)\\&\le \frac{\alpha_i}{12}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}^2}{\alpha_i K_{\min}^2}\sum_{j=1}^N\big(\|u_{j,h}^{n}-u_j(t^n)\|^2+\|u_j(t^n)-u_j(t^{n+1})\|^2\big)\\&\le\frac{\alpha_i}{12}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}^2}{\alpha_i K_{\min}^2}\sum_{j=1}^N\big(2\|\eta_j^n\|^2+2\|\phi_{j,h}^n\|^2+(\Delta t)^2\|u_{j,t}(s^*)\|^2\big)\\&\le\frac{\alpha_i}{12}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}^2}{\alpha_i K_{\min}^2}\big(h^{2k+2}+(\Delta t)^2\big)+\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}^2}{\alpha_i K_{\min}^2}\sum_{j=1}^N\|\phi_{j,h}^n\|^2,
\end{align*}
with $s^*\in[t^n,t^{n+1}]$.
Thus, we have
\begin{align*}   |G(t,u_i,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1})|\le\frac{\alpha_i}{6}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+C\big(h^{2k+2}+(\Delta t)^2\big)+C\sum_{j=1}^N\|\phi_{j,h}^n\|^2.
\end{align*}
Now, using the above bounds, we can rewrite \eqref{all-phi} as\begin{align}
	&\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\left(\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}-\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\|\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\right)+\frac{\alpha_i}{2}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\le \frac{C\beta_i^2}{\alpha_i}\|\nabla\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|^2\|K\|_{\infty,2}^2+\frac{3\mathcal{D}_i^2}{\alpha_i}\|\nabla \eta_{i}^{n+1}\|^2\nonumber\\&+C\sum_{j=1}^N\|\phi_{j,h}^n\|^2+\frac{C(1-\gamma_i)^2\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_\infty^2}{\alpha_i}\|\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}^2}{\alpha_i K_{\min}^2}\|\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|^2+C\big(h^{2k+2}+(\Delta t)^2\big).
\end{align}
Using the regularity assumption again, we obtain
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{2\Delta t}\left(\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}-\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\|\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\right)+\frac{\alpha_i}{2}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\le C\big(h^{2k}+(\Delta t)^2\big)+C\sum_{j=1}^N\|\phi_{j,h}^n\|^2.
\end{align}
Dropping non-negative term from left-hand-side, multiplying both sides by $2\Delta t$, use $\|\phi_{i,h}^0\|=0$, $\Delta{t}M=T$, and summing over time-steps $n=0,1,\cdots,M-1$ to find
\begin{align}
	\|\phi_{i,h}^{M}\|^2+\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=1}^{M}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\le \Delta t\sum\limits_{n=1}^{M-1}C\left(\sum_{j=1}^N\|\phi_{j,h}^n\|^2\right)+C\big(h^{2k}+(\Delta t)^2\big).
\end{align}
Sum over $i=1,2,\cdots,N$, we have
\begin{align}
	\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\|\phi_{i,h}^{M}\|^2+\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=1}^{M}\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\alpha_i\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\right)\le \Delta t\sum\limits_{n=1}^{M-1}C\left(\sum_{i=1}^N\|\phi_{i,h}^n\|^2\right)+C\big(h^{2k}+(\Delta t)^2\big).
\end{align}
Applying the discrete Gr\"onwall Lemma \ref{dgl}, we have
\begin{align}
	\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\|\phi_{i,h}^{M}\|^2+\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=1}^{M}\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\alpha_i\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\right)\le C \big(h^{2k}+(\Delta t)^2\big),
\end{align}
which gives
\begin{align}
	\|\phi_{i,h}^{M}\|^2+\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=1}^{M}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2\le C \big(h^{2k}+(\Delta t)^2\big)\hspace{4mm}\text{for}\hspace{1mm}i=1,2,\cdots,N.\label{bound-on-phi}
\end{align}
Use of triangle and Young's inequalities allows us to write
\begin{align}
	\|e_i^M\|^2+\alpha_i\Delta t\sum_{n=1}^M\|\nabla e_i^n\|^2\le 2\left(\|\phi_{i,h}^{M}\|^2+\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=1}^{M}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|\eta_i^M\|^2+\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=1}^{M}\|\nabla\eta_{i}^{n}\|^2\right).
\end{align}
Using regularity assumptions and bound in \eqref{bound-on-phi}, we have
\begin{align}
	\|u_i(T)-u_{i,h}^M\|^2+\alpha_i\Delta t\sum_{n=1}^M\|\nabla \big(u_i(t^n)-u_{i,h}^n\big)\|^2\le C\big(h^{2k}+(\Delta t)^2\big)\hspace{4mm}\text{for}\hspace{1mm}i=1,2,\cdots,N.
\end{align}
Now, summing over $i=1,2,\cdots,N$ completes the proof.
\end{proof}


\begin{Th} (Error estimation of DBDF-2) For $i=1,2,\cdots,N$, assume $u_i$ solves \eqref{RDE1} and satisfies
\begin{align*}
	u_i\in L^\infty\left(0,T;H^{k+1}(\Omega)^d\right),& u_{i,tt}\in L^\infty\left(0,T;L^2(\Omega)^d\right),u_{i,ttt}\in L^\infty\left(0,T;L^2(\Omega)^d\right),\\
	&r_i\in L^\infty\left(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega)^d\right),\text{ and } K_{\min}>0,
\end{align*}
if $\alpha_i>0$ then for $\Delta t>0$ the solution $u_{i,h}$ to the Algorithm \ref{Algn2} converges to the true solution with
\begin{align}
	\|u_i(T)-u_{i,h}^M\|+\Big\{\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=2}^M\|\nabla(u_i(t^n)-u_{i,h}^n)\|^2\Big\}^{1/2}\le C(h^k+\Delta t^2).
\end{align}\label{Convergence-analysis-BDF-2}
\end{Th}

\begin{proof}
At first we construct an error equation at the time step $t^{n+1}$, the continuous variational formulations can be written as $\forall v_{i,h}\in X_h$
\begin{align}
	\Bigg(&\frac{3u_{i}(t^{n+1})-4u_{i}(t^{n})+u_{i}(t^{n-1})}{2\Delta  t},v_{i,h}\Bigg)+\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla u_{i}(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\beta_i\left( u_{i}(t^{n+1})\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{i,h}\right)\nonumber\\
	&=(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})u_{i}(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right)-\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) u_{i}(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\sum\limits_{j=1}^Nu_{j}(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right)\nonumber\\
	&+\left(\frac{3u_{i}(t^{n+1})-4u_{i}(t^{n})+u_{i}(t^{n-1})}{2\Delta  t}- u_{i,t}(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right)+\left(f_i(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right). \label{cont-weak-form2}
\end{align}
Subtract \eqref{disc-weak-form2} from \eqref{cont-weak-form2} and then rearranging yields
\begin{align}
	&\left(\frac{3e_{i}^{n+1}-4e_{i}^{n}+e_{i}^{n-1}}{2\Delta  t},v_{i,h}\right)+\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla e_{i}^{n+1},\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\beta_i\left(e_{i}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})e_{i}^{n+1},v_{i,h}\right)\nonumber\\
	&+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}e_i^{n+1}(2u_{j,h}^n-u_{j,h}^{n-1}),v_{i,h}
	\right)+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}u_i(t^{n+1})(2e_{j}^n-e_{j}^{n-1}),v_{i,h}
	\right)\nonumber\\
	&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=G(t,u_i,v_{i,h}),
	\label{error-equation2}
\end{align}
where\begin{align*}
	G(t,u_i,v_{i,h})=\left(\frac{3u_{i}(t^{n+1})-4u_{i}(t^{n})+u_{i}(t^{n-1})}{2\Delta  t}- u_{i,t}(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right)\\-\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) u_{i}(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\big\{u_{j}(t^{n+1})-2u_{j}(t^{n})+u_j(t^{n-1})\big\},v_{i,h}\right).
\end{align*}
Now we decompose the errors as\begin{align*}
	e_{i}^n:& = u_i(t^n)-u_{i,h}^n=(u_i(t^n)-\tilde{u}_i^n)-(u_{i,h}^n-\tilde{u}_i^n):=\eta_{i}^n-\phi_{i,h}^n,
\end{align*}
where $\tilde{u}_i^n: =P_{X_h}^{L^2}(u_i(t^n))\in X_h$ is the $L^2$ projections of $u_j(t^n)$ into $X_h$. Note that $(\eta_{i}^n,v_{i,h})=0\hspace{2mm} \forall v_{i,h}\in X_h$.  Rewriting, we have for $v_{i,h}\in X_h$
\begin{align}
	\Bigg(&\frac{3\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}-4\phi_{i,h}^{n}+\phi_{i,h}^{n-1}}{2\Delta  t},v_{i,h}\Bigg)+\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1},\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\beta_i\left( \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\nonumber\\
	&(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\phi_{i,h}^{n+1},v_{i,h}\right)
	+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}(2u_{j,h}^n-u_{j,h}^{n-1}),v_{i,h}
	\right)+\nonumber\\
	&\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}u_i(t^{n+1})(2\phi_{j,h}^{n}-\phi_{j,h}^{n-1}),v_{i,h}
	\right)=\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla \eta_{i}^{n+1},\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\beta_i\left(\eta_{i}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\nonumber\\
	&(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\eta_{i}^{n+1},v_{i,h}\right)+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\eta_i^{n+1}(2u_{j,h}^n-u_{j,h}^{n-1}),v_{i,h}
	\right)+\nonumber\\ 
	&\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}u_i(t^{n+1})(2\eta_{j}^{n}-\eta_{j}^{n-1}),v_{i,h}
	\right)-G(t,u_i,v_{i,h}).\label{phi-equation2}
\end{align}
Choose $v_{i,h}=\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}$, and use the polarization identity in \eqref{ident} to obtain
\begin{align}
	&\frac{1}{4\Delta t}\Big(\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\|\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2+\|2\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}-\phi_{i,h}^{n}\|^2-\|2\phi_{i,h}^{n}-\phi_{i,h}^{n-1}\|^2+\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}-2\phi_{i,h}^{n}+\phi_{i,h}^{n-1}\|^2\Big)\nonumber\\
	&+\mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\beta_i\left(\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)-(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\phi_{i,h}^{n+1},\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)+\nonumber\\
	&\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}(2u_{j,h}^n-u_{j,h}^{n-1}),\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}
	\right)+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}u_i(t^{n+1})(2\phi_{j,h}^{n}-\phi_{j,h}^{n-1}),\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}
	\right)\le \nonumber\\
	&\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla \eta_{i}^{n+1},\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)-\beta_i\left(\eta_{i}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)-(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\eta_{i}^{n+1},\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)+\nonumber\\
	&\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\eta_i^{n+1}(2u_{j,h}^n-u_{j,h}^{n-1}),\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)+\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}u_i(t^{n+1})(2\eta_{j}^{n}-\eta_{j}^{n-1}),\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}
	\right)-G\left(t,u_i,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right).\label{all-phi-2}
\end{align}
Now, we find the upper-bounds of terms in the above equation. Use H\"{o}lder's inequality, Sobolev embedding theorem, and Poincar\'e inequalities, to find 
\begin{align*}
	\left(\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|_{L^3}\|\nabla K(t^{n+1})\|_{L^6}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le C\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^{\frac12}\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^{\frac{1}{2}}\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{H^2(\Omega)^d}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le C\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{L^\infty\big(0,T;H^2(\Omega)^d\big)},\\
	\left(\eta_{i}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le\|\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|_{L^3}\|\nabla K(t^{n+1})\|_{L^6}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le C\|\nabla\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{L^\infty\big(0,T;H^2(\Omega)^d\big)}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|.
\end{align*}
Apply Young's inequality, to have
\begin{align*}
	\beta_i\left(\eta_{i}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\le\frac{\alpha_i}{12}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\frac{C\beta_i^2}{\alpha_i}\|\nabla\eta_{i}^{n+1}\|^2\|K\|_{\infty,2}^2.
\end{align*}
Using H\"older's, and Poincar\'e inequalities, we have
\begin{align*}
	(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})\phi_{i,h}^{n+1},\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le|1-\gamma_i|\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_{\infty}\| \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\\&\le C |1-\gamma_i|\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}\|\nabla \phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2.
\end{align*}
%Next, using triangle, H\"older's, and Poincar\'e inequalities together with the Assumption \ref{assumption-1}, we have
%\begin{align*}
%	-\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left( \frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) }{K(t^{n+1})}\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}u_{j,h}^n,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\frac{\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_{\infty}}{\inf\limits_\Omega\|K(t^{n+1})\|}\Big|\left(\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}u_{j,h}^n,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\Big|\nonumber\\&\le\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\frac{\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}{K_{\min}}\|u_{j,h}^{n}\|_\infty\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\nonumber\\&\le\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}{K_{\min}}
%	\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2.
%\end{align*} 
Next, using triangle, H\"older's, and Poincar\'e inequalities together with the Assumption \ref{assumption-1}, we have
\begin{align*}
	-\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}(2u_{j,h}^n-u_{j,h}^{n-1}),\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}
	\right)&\le\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\Big\|\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\Big\|_{\infty}\|2u_{j,h}^n-u_{j,h}^{n-1}\|_{\infty}\|\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\\
	&\le\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}{K_{\min}}
	\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2.
\end{align*}
With the assumption $\alpha_i>0$, use Cauchy-Schwarz, and Young's inequalities, to obtain
\begin{align*}

%Now we want to find the upper-bound of \begin{align}    G(t,u_i,\phi_{i,h}^{n+1})=\left(\frac{u_{i}(t^{n+1})-u_{i}(t^{n})}{\Delta  t}- u_{i,t}(t^{n+1}),\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\nonumber\\+\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1}) u_{i}(t^{n+1})}{K(t^{n+1})}\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\big\{u_{j,h}^{n}-u_{j}(t^{n+1})\big\},\phi_{i,h}^{n+1}\right).\label{G-phi-2}

	\end{align}
	Dropping non-negative term from left-hand-side, multiply both sides by $4\Delta t$, using $\|\phi_{i,h}^0\|=\|\phi_{i,h}^1\|=0$, and sum over the time-steps $n=1,2,\cdots,M-1$, we have
	\begin{align}
		\|\phi_{i,h}^{M}\|^2+\|2\phi_{i,h}^{M}-\phi_{i,h}^{M-1}\|^2+2\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=2}^M\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^n\|^2\nonumber\\\le C\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=1}^{M-1}\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\|2\phi_{j,h}^{n}-\phi_{j,h}^{n-1}\|^2+C(h^{2k}+\Delta t^4).
	\end{align}
	Summing over $i=1,2,\cdots,N$, remove non-negative terms from left-hand-side, and reducing, gives
	\begin{align*}
		\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\|\phi_{i,h}^{M}\|^2+2\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=2}^M\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^n\|^2\le C\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=2}^{M-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\|\phi_{i,h}^n\|^2+C(h^{2k}+\Delta t^4).
	\end{align*}
	Applying the discrete Gr\"onwall Lemma \ref{dgl}, we have
	\begin{align}
		\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\|\phi_{i,h}^{M}\|^2+2\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=2}^M\sum\limits_{i=1}^N\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^n\|^2\le C(h^{2k}+\Delta t^4),
	\end{align}
	for $i=1,2,\cdots,N$, which gives
	\begin{align}
		\|\phi_{i,h}^{M}\|^2+2\alpha_i\Delta t\sum\limits_{n=2}^M\|\nabla\phi_{i,h}^n\|^2\le C(h^{2k}+\Delta t^4).
	\end{align}
	The proof is completed by the use of the triangle and Young's inequalities, as well as the regularity assumption.
\end{proof}
Now we prove the assumption  $\|u_{i,h}^n\|_{\infty}\le C$ that was used in stability Theorems \ref{stability-theorm}-\ref{stability-theorm2}  and in convergence Theorems \ref{Convergence-analysis-BE}-\ref{Convergence-analysis-BDF-2} by the principle of mathematical induction. The technique this proof is based on Wong's notion in the analysis of three-species competition model \cite{wong2009analysis}. We define
\begin{align*}
	M^*:=\max_{0\le n\le M}\|u_i(t^n)\|_{\infty}. 
\end{align*}

\begin{Lemma}
	If $u_i(0,{\bf x})$ is sufficiently regular for ${\bf x}\in\Omega$, then $\|u_{i,h}^n\|_{\infty}\le K^*$, $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$, where $K^*$ is a positive constant.\label{lemma-discrete-bound}
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Basic step: $u_{i,h}^0=I_h(u_i(0,{\bf x})),$ where $I_h$ is an appropriate interpolation operator. Because of the regularity assumption of $u_i(0,{\bf x})$, we have $\|u_{i,h}^0\|_\infty\le K^*$, for some constant $K^*>0$.\\
	Inductive step: Assume for some $L\in\mathbb{N}$ and $L<M$, $\|u_{i,h}^n\|_\infty\le K^*$ holds true for $n=0,1,\cdots,L$. Then we have
	\begin{align*}
		\|u_{i,h}^{L+1}\|_\infty&=\|u_{i,h}^{L+1}-u_i(t^{L+1})+u_i(t^{L+1})\|_{\infty}\\&\le\|u_{i,h}^{L+1}-u_i(t^{L+1})\|_{\infty}+\|u_i(t^{L+1})\|_{\infty}.
	\end{align*}
	Using Agmon’s inequality \cite{Robinson2016Three-Dimensional}, and discrete inverse inequality, yields
	\begin{align*}
		\|u_{i,h}^{L+1}\|_\infty&\le Ch^{-\frac{3}{2}}\|u_{i,h}^{L+1}-u_i(t^{L+1})\|+M^*\\&\le Ch^{-\frac{3}{2}}\left(\|\phi_{i,h}^{L+1}\|+\|\eta_i^{L+1}\|\right)+M^*\hspace{2mm}\text{(Triangle inequality)}.
	\end{align*}
	Use inductive hypothesis to get \eqref{bound-on-phi}, and  approximation property \eqref{AppPro3}, the above bound can be written as
	\begin{align}
		\|u_{i,h}^{L+1}\|_\infty\le C \big(h^{k-\frac{3}{2}}+h^{-\frac{3}{2}}\Delta t+h^{k-\frac{1}{2}}\big)+M^*.
	\end{align}
	We note that the above bound is independent of $L$, that is, the bound is not affected by time. For $k>3/2$, and sufficiently small $h$ and $\Delta t$ such that
	\begin{align*}
		h^{k-\frac32}\le\frac{1}{C}\hspace{2mm}\text{and}\hspace{2mm}\Delta t\le \frac{h^\frac{3}{2}}{C},
	\end{align*}
	we have 
	\begin{align*}
		\|u_{i,h}^{L+1}\|_\infty\le 3+M^*.
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, $\|u_{i,h}^{L+1}\|_\infty\le K^*$ holds also true for $K^*\ge 3+M^*$. Hence, by the principle of strong mathematical induction, $\|u_{i,h}^n\|_\infty\le K^*$ holds true  $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Numerical Tests}\label{numerical-experiments}
For this section, we consider $N=3$, so that the density of three species will be $(u_1,u_2,u_3)$. For our convenience we assume $(u_1,u_2,u_3)\equiv(u,v,w)$ and the system \eqref{RDE1} reads as follows
\begin{align} 
	\label{systemN}
	\begin{cases}
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		&\displaystyle\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}= \nabla\cdot\left({d_1}\nabla{{u}}-{\beta_1}{u}\right)+ru{\left[1-\gamma_1-\frac{u+u_2+u_3}{K}\right]},\\
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		&\displaystyle \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}= \nabla\cdot\left({d_2}\nabla{{v}}-{\beta_2}{v}\right)+rv{\left[1-\gamma_2-\frac{u+v+u_3}{K}\right]},\\
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		&\displaystyle \frac{\partial w}{\partial t}= \nabla\cdot\left({d_3}\nabla{{w}}-{\beta_3}{w}\right)+rw{\left[1-\gamma_3-\frac{u+v+w}{K}\right]}.
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
where we assume the forcing functions $f_1=f_2=f_3=0$ and with equal initial densities $({u}_0,{v}_0,{w}_0)=(1.6,1.6,1.6)$.
\subsection{Test 1: Evolution of Density of Population with Exponentially Varying Carrying Capacity}\label{exp-2}
In this section we consider the exponentially varying carrying capacity
$$K(t,{\bf x})\equiv\big(1.2+2.5\pi^2e^{-(x-0.5)^2-(y-0.5)^2}\big)\big(1.0+0.3\cos(t)\big),$$
with initial density $({u}_0,{v}_0,{w}_0)=(1.6,1.6,1.6)$, constant intrinsic growth rates $r_1=r_2=r_3=1.0$, diffusion coefficients $\mathcal{D}_i=1.0$ and advection coefficients $\beta_i=1.0$, for $i=1,2,3$. Here we assume the harvesting coefficients of the three species are $\gamma_1=0.0009, \gamma_2=0.0025$ and $\gamma_3=0.005$, respectively. For exponentially varying carrying capacity we display the surface distribution of three species and contour plots of $u, v$ and $w$.

\end{figure}
The Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0009-nu-0-0025-K-time-exp}(a) depicts that there exists a coexistence among three species. From the contour plots \ref{RDE-energy-0-0009-nu-0-0025-K-time-exp}(c,d,e), it is clear that for higher harvesting rate the density profile of third species is smaller than the other two species where the first species has larger density as it is less harvested then the density of second. Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0009-nu-0-0025-K-time-exp}(b) illustrates the average density of three species. All the species will coexist because of different harvesting parameters.
\subsection{Test 2: Evolution of Density of Population with Space and Time Dependent Carrying Capacity}\label{sp-2}
In this section we consider the spatially and temporarily varying carrying capacity
$$K(t,{\bf x})\equiv(1.5+\sin(x)\sin(y))(1.2+\sin(t)),$$
with initial density $(u_0,v_0,w_0)=(1.6,1.6,1.6)$ and constant intrinsic growth rates $r_1=r_2=r_3=1.0$, diffusion coefficients $\mathcal{D}_i=1.0$ and advection coefficients $\beta_i=0$ for $i=1,2,3$. Here we assume the harvesting coefficients of the three species are $\gamma_1=0.0009,\ \gamma_2=0.0025$ and $\gamma_3=0.005$ respectively. For space and time dependent carrying capacity we display the surface plot of three species and contour plots of $u, v$ and $w$. The Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0009-nu-0-0025-K-time-exp}(b) depicts that three species will coexist. It is clear from Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0009-nu-0-0025-K-time-exp}(a,c,d,e) that a quasiperiodic behavior and coexistence observed among the three species because of space dependent carrying capacity.

with initial density $(u_0,v_0,w_0)=(1.6,1.6,1.6)$ and constant intrinsic growth rates $r_1=r_2=r_3=1.0$. We wish to see how the diffusion and advection parameter affects the population density of each species. The surface plot, contour plot and plot of average densities are presented for species $u$, $v$ and $w$, respectively for different diffusion and advection rates. For this we consider the following two cases:
\subsubsection{Case I: Evolution of Density of Population with Different Diffusion Parameters}
Here we assume $\mathcal{D}_i=0.0076,\ 0.025,\ \text{and}\ 0.5\ \text{and}\ \beta_i= 0.001\ \text{for}\ i=1,2,3$. Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-sp}(a,b,c) illustrate that for larger diffusion rate the third species will persist. It is clear from Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-sp}(d,e,f) that the third species has smaller density than the first and second species where the density profile of first is very high for very small diffusion rate.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Case II: Evolution of Density of Population with Different Advection Parameters}
Here we assume $\mathcal{D}_i=0.5\ \text{and}\ \beta_i=0.0076,\ 0.025,\ \text{and}\ 0.05\ \text{for}\ i=1,2,3$. Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-sp4}(a,b,c) show a coexistence among three species where the density of first species is higher for smaller advection rate than the other two species.

\end{figure}
It is clear from Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-sp4}(d,e,f) that there is a small difference among the densities of three species for different advection rates and keeping fixed the diffusion rates. A strong coexistence is observed because of equal diffusion rate and zero harvesting effort.
\subsection{Test 4: Evolution of Density of Population with Space Dependent Intrinsic Growth Rates}\label{hegr-1}
In this section we consider the exponentially varying carrying capacity
$$K(t,{\bf x})\equiv\big(1.2+2.5\pi^2e^{-(x-0.5)^2-(y-0.5)^2}\big)\big(1.0+0.3\cos(t)\big),$$
with initial density $(u_0,v_0,w_0)=(1.6,1.6,1.6)$ and constant intrinsic growth rates $r_1=r_2=r_3=1.1+0.75\cos(x)\cos(y)$.

\end{figure}
Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-sp3}(a,b) show a strong coexistence among three species. Contour plots in \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-sp3}(c,d,e) depict that the density of first species is higher than the second and the density of second is higher compared to third.
\subsection{Test 5: Effects of Harvesting on the Evolution of Density of Population}\label{he-2}
In this section we consider the exponentially varying carrying capacity
$$K(t,{\bf x})\equiv\big(1.2+2.5\pi^2e^{-(x-0.5)^2-(y-0.5)^2}\big)\big(1.0+0.3\cos(t)\big),$$
with initial density $(u_0,v_0,w_0)=(1.6,1.6,1.6)$ and space dependent intrinsic growth rates $r_1=r_2=r_3\equiv(1.5+\sin(x)sin(y))(1.2+\sin(t))$. In the following Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he5} we have assumed the equal diffusion rates\ $\mathcal{D}_1=\mathcal{D}_2=\mathcal{D}_3=0.5$\ and the advection rates\ $\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta_3=0.5$. It is clear from Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he5}(c,d,e) that because of the harvesting effect on the third species the density of it has been reduced and the other two will coincide. The Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he5}(c,d,e) represents the density profile of each of three species where the density of $u$\ and\ $v$ are same while the density of $w$\ is smaller than them. Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he5}(a) shows that the surfaces $u$\ and\ $v$ coincide because of equal densities. This is because the equal diffusion and advection rates.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he5}(b) presents the average density of each of the three species over the time interval $[0,80]$, where only the third species is affected by harvesting rate $\gamma_3=0.007$ while keeping the other two species remain harvest free.\\

In the following Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he4} we have assumed the equal diffusion rates\ $\mathcal{D}_1=\mathcal{D}_2=\mathcal{D}_3=1.0$, the advection rates\ $\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta_3=1.0$\ and constant intrinsic growth rates\ $r_1=r_2=r_3=1.0$.

\end{figure}
In the Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he4}(a,b) the second species will extinct as it is harvested in the rate $\gamma_2=0.025$ and the other two are free from harvest. Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he4}(c,d,e) represents the contour plot of species $u$,\ $v$,\ and\ $w$ where the densities of \ $u$,\ and\ $w$\ are same because of diffusion, advection and harvesting rate are same while the density of third species is reduced.

\end{figure} 
It is clear from Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he3}(c,d,e) that because the harvesting effect on the first species the density of it has been reduced and the other two will coincide. The Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he3}(c,d,e) represents the density profile of each of three species where the density of $v$\ and\ $w$ are same while the density of $u$\ is smaller than them. Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he3}(a) shows that the surfaces $v$\ and\ $w$ coincide because of equal densities. This is because the equal diffusion and advection rates.

\end{figure}
We consider the harvesting rates $\gamma_1=0.05>\gamma_2=0.008>\gamma_3=0.0006$\ and the diffusion rate and advection rate are equal in the Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he2}. It is clearly observed that the first species will die out in \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he2}(a,b,c) as the harvesting rate of first species is higher than the other two species. So the second and third species will persist. Though the density profile of third species is very high compared to the second species in the Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he2}(d,e) as the third species adopt very small harvesting rate.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
It is remarkable to mention that in Figure \ref{RDE-energy-0-0-nu-0-0-K-time-he6}(a,b,c) the first species will totally vanish as the harvesting rate exceeds the intrinsic growth rate while the other two will persist because the harvesting rates of $v$\ and\ $w$ do not exceeds the intrinsic growth rate of them. Though the contour plots of the species $v$\ and\ $w$\ illustrate that the density of $v$ is higher than $w$ because the harvesting rate of $v$ is smaller than $w$.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
We introduced a system of nonlinear coupled partial differential equations in this chapter to represent the dynamics of a $N$-species reaction-diffusion-advection model with harvesting and/or stocking effects. We proposed two fully discrete decoupled stable methods for numerical computation. We established that the first scheme is first-order correct in time and second-order correct in space. At each time step, the linearized decoupling methods are efficient and can compute the solution for each species concurrently. This can significantly reduce computing time when simulating large-scale computationally expensive complicated challenges.  
Numerical illustrations demonstrate
\begin{itemize}
	\item [(a)] if the harvesting rate increases, then the population density will decrease and the species with a higher harvesting rate will extinct; 
	\item[(b)] for space-dependent carrying capacity, there is a periodic behavior in the solution; 
	\item[(c)] with the absence of harvesting effect and a constant advection rate, the species with a higher diffusion rate will extinct; 
	\item[(d)] for different advection rates, there exists a coexistence among three species with the absence of harvesting effect and constant diffusion rate; 
	\item[(e)] a strong coexistence is observed for space-dependent intrinsic growth rates; 
	\item[(f)] if there is no harvesting effect of two species where one species is harvested, then the density of harvest-free species will be the same and the density of harvested species will be reduced; 
	\item[(g)] the higher the harvesting rate, the lower the density, and 
	\item[(h)] if the harvesting rate of one species surpass the intrinsic growth rate, then it will totally vanish and the other two will coexist.
\end{itemize}

%Numerical experiments exhibit (a) if the diffusion rate increases and the advection rate decreases, then the population density decreases and faster the process of extinction, (b) if the harvesting coefficient of a species increases, its density decreases, and other species get benefit in the competition, and (c) if the stocking effect of a species intensify, the population density increases and tends to win over the other species in the competition, that is, the survival period of the species increases. For a particular competition model, a set of values of the harvesting or stocking coefficients can be found for which co-existence of all species will be ensured.% The harvesting and/or stocking coefficient can be a useful as a control in the population dynamics with limited natural resources. In the future, we plan to explore the problem of uncertainty quantification and model parameter estimation for practical applications.
% \textcolor{magenta}{Harvesting or stocking modeling based on convection diffusion reaction parabolic problem \cite{chandru2018numerical} also could be a new research avenue.}
%As a future research, we will propose, analyze and test an efficient decoupled algorithm for this $N$-species competition model following the works in \cite{MR17,mohebujjaman2022efficient} so that at each time-step each species solver shares a common system matrix which will further save computer memory and assembling time of system matrix.

\section*{Appendix} \label{appendix} Here we
find the restriction on the time-step size to have the stability of the Algorithm \ref{Algn1}. We consider the following linear system:
\begin{align}
	a(u_{i,h}^{n+1},v_{i,h})=F\left(v_{i,h}\right),\hspace{1mm}\forall v_{i,h}\in X_h,\hspace{1mm}i=1,2,\cdots,N,\label{linear-system}
\end{align}
where the linear form
\begin{align}
	F\left(v_{i,h}\right):=\frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(u_{i,h}^{n},v_{i,h}\right)+\left(f_i(t^{n+1}),v_{i,h}\right),
\end{align}
and  the  bilinear form

\begin{align}
	a\left(u_{i,h}^{n+1},v_{i,h}\right):&=\frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(u_{i,h}^{n+1},v_{i,h}\right)+\mathcal{D}_i\left(\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1},\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\beta_i\left( u_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-\nonumber\\
	&(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})u_{i,h}^{n+1},v_{i,h}\right)-\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})u_{i,h}^{n+1}}{K(t^{n+1})}\sum\limits_{j=1}^Nu_{j,h}^n,v_{i,h}
	\right).\label{bilinear-form}
\end{align}
Now, substitute $v_{i,h}=u_{i,h}^{n+1}$ in \eqref{bilinear-form} to give
\begin{align}
	a&\left(u_{i,h}^{n+1},u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)=\frac{1}{\Delta t}\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\beta_i\left( u_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla v_{i,h}\right)-(1-\gamma_i)\left(r_i(t^{n+1})u_{i,h}^{n+1},u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\nonumber\\
	&-\left(\frac{r_i(t^{n+1})u_{i,h}^{n+1}}{K(t^{n+1})}\sum\limits_{j=1}^Nu_{j,h}^n,u_{i,h}^{n+1}
	\right)\nonumber\\
	&\ge \frac{1}{\Delta t}\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-C\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{H^2(\Omega)^d}-|1-\gamma_i|\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_{\infty}\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-\nonumber\\
	&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\frac{C\|r_i(t^{n+1})\|_{\infty}}{\inf\limits_\Omega\|K(t^{n+1})\|}\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2.
\end{align}
%For the first term on the right-hand-side of \eqref{pol-new}, we use H\"{o}lder's inequality, Sobolev embedding theorem, and Poincar\'e inequalities, to find the following estimate
%\begin{align*}
%	\left(u_{i,h}^{n+1}\nabla K(t^{n+1}),\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)&\le\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|_{L^3}\|\nabla K(t^{n+1})\|_{L^6}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le C\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^{\frac12}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^{\frac12} \| K(t^{n+1})\|_{H^2(\Omega)}\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|\\&\le C\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{H^2(\Omega)^d}.
%\end{align*}
The last term in the above inequality is derived as the lower bound subject to the Assumption \ref{assumption-1}. Rearranging
\begin{align}
	&a\left(u_{i,h}^{n+1},u_{i,h}^{n+1}\right)\ge\left(\frac{1}{\Delta t}-|1-\gamma_i|\|r_i\|_{L^\infty\big(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega)^d\big)}-\frac{C\|r_i\|_{L^\infty\big(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega)^d\big)}}{\inf\limits_{(t,{\bf x})\in (0,T]\times\Omega}|K|}\right)\|u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2+\nonumber\\
	&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\mathcal{D}_i\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2-C\|\nabla u_{i,h}^{n+1}\|^2\|K(t^{n+1})\|_{H^2(\Omega)^d}.
\end{align}
To have the coercivity condition, we must have
\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{\Delta t}-|1-\gamma_i|\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}-\frac{C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}{K_{\min}}\ge 0,
\end{align*}
which gives the following restriction on the time-step size
\begin{align}
	\Delta t\le\frac{K_{\min}}{|1-\gamma_i|\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}K_{\min}+C\|r_i\|_{\infty,\infty}}.\label{time-step-restriction}
\end{align}
In a similar approach, we can find the time-step restriction on the stability of the Algorithm \ref{Algn2}.
